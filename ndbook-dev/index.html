    <div class="block-paragraph_container">
      <div class="block-paragraph clearfix">
        <p>Nicole A. Duncan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised by her maternal grandmother.  Though she was a product of an unfavorable environment, surrounded by the drug world, God had a plan for her life.  Nicole attended, and graduated from Paul Laurence Dunbar High School.</p>
        
        <p>Nicole is unwavering in her faith; she is an active and dedicated member of Faith Christian Worship Center under the anointed leadership of Pastor Gary G Johnson, and First Lady Naomi Johnson.  Pastor Gary has been instrumental in Nicole’s faith, development, and helping her to define her purpose in life.  Nicole committed her life to the service of God, as a leader in her church.</p>
        
        <p>Knowing the adverse impact of being raised without both parents, she prides herself on her dedication to her family, particularly her role as a mother and sister.  Nicole believes the word of God, and is adamant about rearing and admonishing her children in the knowledge of Christ.  Being a mirror for her children, Nicole does not believe in simply being average.  Even though difficulties and struggles in life, she holds fast to Romans 8:28, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose.”</p>
